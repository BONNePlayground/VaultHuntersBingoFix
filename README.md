# Vault Hunters Bingo Fix Mod

This mod addresses the issue with Bingo tiles in a vault that rely on rooms inside the vault. It targets 2 tasks: free a villager and find a vault room.

These 2 tasks are removed from the bingo tiles pool if it is predicted that no rooms will be required in the vault.

These 2 tasks are limited to having max-amount on player joining the vault to be the same as the total room count generated. So you will always be able to complete it.

As this is based onÂ prediction rooms, this mod may stop working under certain situations or significant VH code changes.
